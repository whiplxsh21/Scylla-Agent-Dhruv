        "# Self Reflective RAG Agent\n",
        "### What is it?\n",
        "A self reflective RAG agent is an agent that after creating a response, is critical of its own responses and evaluates weather to revise or retrieve it again from the vector store. The main paper regarding this is [linked here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Outline of what the agent does:\n",
        "- Based on the user's query, it gets a response like a normal RAG\n",
        "- But instead of taking this first reponse directly, it will reflect on weather this answer was helpful/accurate/sufficient\n",
        "- If not, it will execute a re-retrieval or revise the answer or generate a new query altogether\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tools being used:\n",
        "- **LLM**: Groq (`llama3-8b` or `mixtral`)\n",
        "- **LangChain**: For retrieval, prompt templates and chaining\n",
        "- **LangGraph**: For controlling the overall flow (especially the reflective feedback loop)\n",
        "- **Embeddings**: Hugging Face embeddings cos im too broke to pay for OpenAI\n",
        "- **Vector Store**: FAISS\n",
        "- **FileLoader**: PyPDFLoader for PDF-Files\n",

        "**Final Answer:**\n",

        "**Final Answer:**\n",
        "> Considering these points, it's likely that working remotely from another country for 2 months might not be allowed or might require special approval from the ED/CEO. I would recommend reaching out to the ED/CEO or HR department to discuss your specific situation and get clarification on the organization's policies regarding remote work and international travel.\n",

        "> yes, i would recommend retrying. the answer is vague and incomplete, and it doesn't provide a clear yes or no answer to the original question. while it attempts to interpret the policy, it doesn't provide a definitive answer and instead suggests that the employee should reach out to the ed/ceo or hr department for clarification. a retry could provide a more direct and clear answer to the question. \n",

        "**Final Answer:**\n",
        ">According to the provided context, the policy states that maintaining a professional, business-like appearance is important for the success of the Foundation. Although there is no specific mention of internal team meetings, it can be inferred that the expectation of professional attire applies to all interactions, including internal meetings.Therefore, it is likely that casual clothes may not be acceptable in internal team meetings. It's best to dress in a professional and business-like manner to maintain a positive impression and align with the Foundation's expectations.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Final Answer:**\n",
        ">Based on the provided context, it does not appear that there is any specific mention of combining paid leave with international remote work. The policies and procedures mentioned only discuss general holiday pay, vacation pay, and leave entitlements, but do not address remote work or international work arrangements.\n",
        "> However, it's possible that the organization may have additional policies or procedures that address remote work or international work arrangements. I would recommend checking with the organization's HR department or management to determine their specific policies and procedures regarding remote work and leave entitlements.  \n",

        "\n",
        "**Final Answer:**\n",
        ">Based on the provided context, it seems that the 10 days of leave mentioned are actually part of the Personal Leave, which is a separate category from vacation time. The Personal Leave is intended for emergency situations, and it does not affect seniority, benefits, or the employee's position.\n",
